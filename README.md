## Features

- User authentication and authorization using Spring Security.
- Database persistence using Hibernate and JPA.
- JSON Web Token (JWT) based authentication for stateless communication.
- Customizable configuration for various security aspects.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Security**: Used for implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Hibernate**: Object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for database interactions.
- **JPA (Java Persistence API)**: Standard specification for ORM in Java applications.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for stateless authentication between client and server.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash

    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    mvn install
    ```

## Configuration

Before running the application, you need to configure the following settings:

1. Database Configuration: Configure the database connection properties in `application.properties` file.

2. Security Configuration: Customize security settings such as authentication providers, user roles, and access control in the security configuration files.

## Usage

Once the project is set up and configured, you can run the application using:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
